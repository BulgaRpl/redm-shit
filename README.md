### Simple NUI Weapon Spawner
Really just built it to test the new NUI implementations in RedM(11/16/19).  
Pressing the UP arrow opens the menu. Select the weapon from the dropdown and click spawn weapon.  
You'll need your own way to despawn the weapons since the weapon wheel is broken only 1 weapon is really usable.


### FPS Counter
Since the current version of RedM doesn't have cl_drawfps I went ahead and added it myself.  
Works the same way as the default cl_drawfps. Enable and disable it with 1 and 0 respectively.  
Instead of drawing in the top left it draws in the bottom left near the minimap. This is just my choice since my debug tools use the top left.
